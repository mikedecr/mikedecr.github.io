      <description>I just finished a major website overhaul. While it took only about one day of work, I’ve had my eyes open for a new theme for Hugo for a while.
I mean, a while. I would download a theme, give it a 15-minute test run offline, and decide that it wasn’t for me. I did that maybe a dozen times.1
But this is mainly my fault. I am a bad combination of picky and unskilled with websites and web design, which made me a fickle chooser throughout the process.</description>

      <title>Packages &amp; Reproducibility: Install what you need, attach what you want</title>

      <description>(Note: An earlier version of this post referred to “loading” packages when I really meant “attaching.” Thanks to Thomas Leeper for the clarification.)
When we distribute R code (for publication/replication archives, on Github, through blog posts, etc), we like the code to run smoothly on someone else’s machine. Packages present a nominal problem because different users have different packages installed on their computer. Ideally the script we are distributing should install dependencies without the redundancy of re-installing packages that a user already has installed.</description>
