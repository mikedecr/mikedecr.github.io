      <title>Causal Mediation, Bayesianly (with Stan)</title>

      <description>Motivation for this post Over this summer, I have been organizing a reading group on causal inference for students in my department. As someone who sees data analysis problems primarily through Bayesian goggles, I have been doing extra work in my head to make sense of “Bayesian causal inference.” I’m hoping to write some articles about this for political scientists, but the dissertation (rightly) has more of my attention lately.</description>

      <title>Experimentalists Agree! When Flat Priors Lead to Worse Learning</title>

      <description>I’ve been reading about Bayesian causal inference for a paper I’m hoping to write, and this has led me to dig into the work by Gerber, Green, and Kaplan about the “Illusion of Learning from Observational Research.” In it, they put forth a model to describe how much you “update” your information about causal effects from experimental vs observational research.
The intuition of the model is to suppose that we want to learn about some causal effect \(M\).</description>
