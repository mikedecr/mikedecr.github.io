      <description>When we distribute R code (for publication/replication archives, on Github, through blog posts, etc), we like the code to run smoothly on someone else’s machine. Packages present a nominal problem because different users have different packages installed on their computer. Ideally the script we are distributing should install dependencies without the redundancy of re-installing packages that a user already has installed. To this end, many users conditionally install packages using require(); if a package fails to load, it is installed.</description>
