      <description>I just finished a major website overhaul. While it took only about one day of work, I’ve had my eyes open for a new theme for Hugo for a while.
I mean, a while. I would download a theme, give it a 15-minute test run offline, and decide that it wasn’t for me. I did that maybe a dozen times.1
But this is mainly my fault. I am a bad combination of picky and unskilled with websites and web design, which made me a fickle chooser throughout the process.</description>
