<h2 id="do-primaries-work-nomination-politics-and-the-representation-of-local-partisan-preferences">Do Primaries Work? Nomination Politics and the Representation of Local Partisan Preferences.</h2>

<p>Partisan voters are historically unlikely to cast their votes for the opposing party, so the primary nomination process is perhaps more consequential than ever. Theoretical and empirical scholarship on candidate positioning argues that the primary process is the predominant reason for divergent candidate positions across parties. I argue that the core predictions from the prevailing theory of primaries lacks direct empirical support. Are primary candidate positions meaningfully related to the preferences of district co-partisans? Do extreme primary constituencies elect extreme primary candidates? I develop Bayesian methods for estimating local partisan preferences and primary candidate positions, and I explore whether the leading view of primaries&mdash;and in turn, about the nature of candidate positioning in the US&mdash;enjoys empirical support.</p>

<p>The 2016 presidential campaign was defined by gender to a remarkable degree, which led many observers to expect a historically large gender gap in voting. In reality, the difference between men and women&rsquo;s votes in 2016 was only slightly larger than in other recent elections. We argue that an immense gender divide did not emerge because it was constrained by high levels of partisanship in the electorate, especially “negative partisanship” toward the opposing party that leaves little room for gender to make a difference on the margins. In addition, we challenge two common assumptions: that the gender gap helps Democratic candidates and that women were more persuadable than men over the course of the campaign. Both men and women vacillated in their views of Clinton&rsquo;s honesty during the campaign, with men shifting away from her and toward Trump just before election day.</p>

<p>Does the gender gap help the Democrats? Do Republicans win more votes when the gender gap is smaller? We provide a generalizable theoretical framework to understand the link between group differences in vote choice, turnout, and party vote shares, with an application to the gender gap. Our approach views both the gender gap and partisan election outcomes as underlying partisan predispositions in the electorate that are transformed through partisan mobilization, partisan defection, and the choices of unaffiliated voters. We provide a strategy for measuring the effects of these forces on a common scale. We show that the size of the gender gap has no <em>necessary</em> bearing on the partisan vote outcome, but it may have a <em>contingent</em> relationship based on how partisan predispositions are translated into votes through the mobilization of party supporters and the persuasion of non-supporters.</p>

<p>Although the gender gap and the Democratic vote in presidential elections have both increased over time, we show that this relationship is almost entirely spurious. The primary cause of the gender gap (partisan change among men) was harmful to the Democrats. Meanwhile, the forces that increased the Democratic vote (greater mobilization and less defection among Democratic partisans) were relatively gender neutral.</p>

<p>Our framework can be extended to understand how other group cleavages affect election outcomes.</p>

Mayer) <a href="https://uwmadison.box.com/s/i5tqmenqxtjt0hhx39rfu59340gb0fcj">(PDF)</a></h2>

<p>How much did Wisconsin&rsquo;s voter identification requirement matter in 2016? We conducted a survey of registered Wisconsin nonvoters in the counties surrounding Milwaukee and Madison to estimate the number of registered voters who were affected by the voter ID requirement in 2016. We estimate that roughly 11 percent of nonvoters in these counties lack a qualifying voter ID or report that voter ID was at least a partial reason why they did not vote in 2016, and 6 percent of nonvoters lack a voter ID or cite voter ID as their primary reason for not voting. We also find evidence of confusion about the law, with many respondents mistakenly believing that they did not have the necessary ID to vote when they actually did. Less knowledge about what forms of ID were acceptable was associated with a higher likelihood of being affected. We include a simulation of counterfactual turnout to demonstrate a range of plausible turnout effects.</p>
