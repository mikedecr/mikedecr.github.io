      <description>Objective The goal of this lesson is to simulate some data manipulation for a research project. This requires…
 setting up the project on your computer Get data onto our computer (the ANES should already be downloaded!) Load the data into R Cleaning and modifying the data Doing some simple calculations using the data  Future lessons pick up where this one leaves off. We will be making graphics and doing statistical analysis.</description>

      <description>I am a doctoral student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison. I study American politics and statistical methodology.
My research focuses on electoral politics, broadly construed (representation, voting, public opinion, and election administration) and Bayesian data analysis. My dissertation explores primary elections and the representation of local constituency preferences.
I am an affiliate of the Elections Research Center, where I also serve as the graduate student assistant.</description>

      <description>Dissertation Do Primaries Work? Nomination Politics and the Representation of Local Partisan Preferences.
Partisan voters are historically unlikely to cast their votes for the opposing party, so the primary nomination process is perhaps more consequential than ever. Theoretical and empirical scholarship on candidate positioning argues that the primary process is the predominant reason for divergent candidate positions across parties. I argue that the core predictions from the prevailing theory of primaries lacks direct empirical support.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with R</title>
      <link>https://mikedecr.github.io/811/811-basics/</link>

      <description>Objectives This document describes how to get started with R and understand its basics. We discuss installing R, running simple commands, and some elementary programming concepts such as indexing, logic, and functions. We close with some higher-level discussion about the differences between R and Stata.
Note: This lesson will be more “abstract” than other lessons in this series. This is because we exploring R’s general behavior rather than a concrete application of R workflow.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the online lessons for PS 811: Introduction to Statistical Computing for Political Science. This series of blog posts contain instructional notes for using R for political science research.
A little about R R is not the only program out there for doing statistical programming, so let’s begin by talking about what makes it unique.
Compared to other popular statistical software for the social scientists (such as Stata), R stands out as a more general programming language.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>
      <link>https://mikedecr.github.io/post/2016/12/30/a-plain-markdown-post/</link>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>Github This website is continuously undergoing revisions. For code currently that has no home on this page, feel free to dig through my Github repositories.
 Sublime Text User Settings Available on Github. Highlights include:
 Keybindings for R and \(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\) (primarily) and associated macro files. Code snippets for \(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\) and R, plus some here and there for Stan, Stata, HTML, and Markdown. A modified Solarized color scheme based on the guts of the Cobalt2 scheme for Sublime, light and dark versions.</description>
