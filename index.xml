      <description>Schedule: Read this before our first R lecture.
 How to follow along A script file walking through some of these commands is available here.
 Objectives The goal of this lesson is to simulate some data manipulation for a research project. This requires…
 setting up the project on your computer Get data onto the computer (the ANES should already be downloaded!) Load the data into R Cleaning and modifying the data Doing some simple calculations  Future lessons pick up where this one leaves off, so you must complete this lesson!</description>

      <title>Getting Started with R</title>

      <description>Schedule: Read this before our first R lecture.
 How to follow along Follow the instructions in this lesson in your own .R script.
 Objectives This document describes how to get started with R and understand its basics. We discuss installing R, running simple commands, and some elementary programming concepts such as indexing, logic, and functions. We close with some higher-level discussion about the differences between R and Stata.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the online lessons for PS 811: Introduction to Statistical Computing for Political Science. This series of blog posts contain instructional notes for using R for political science research.
This current post contains a few introductory remarks about R, how I intend to teach R, and the structure of our coming lessons.
Schedule: Read this before our first R lecture.
 A little about R R is not the only program out there for doing statistical programming, so let’s begin by talking about what makes it unique.</description>

      <description>I am a doctoral student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison. I study American politics and statistical methodology.
My research focuses on electoral politics, broadly construed (representation, voting, public opinion, and election administration) and Bayesian data analysis. My dissertation explores primary elections and the representation of local constituency preferences.
I am an affiliate of the Elections Research Center, where I also serve as the graduate student assistant.</description>

      <description>Dissertation Do Primaries Work? Nomination Politics and the Representation of Local Partisan Preferences.
Partisan voters are historically unlikely to cast their votes for the opposing party, so the primary nomination process is perhaps more consequential than ever. Theoretical and empirical scholarship on candidate positioning argues that the primary process is the predominant reason for divergent candidate positions across parties. I argue that the core predictions from the prevailing theory of primaries lacks direct empirical support.</description>
