<p>I joined DRW Holdings as a quantitative researcher in October 2020.
I use statistics and machine learning to research financial markets and, some day, develop principled trading strategies.</p>
<p>I hold a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I used Bayesian statistical methods to study U.S. elections and public opinion with the <a href="https://elections.wisc.edu/">Elections Research Center</a>.
My dissertation developed new Bayesian methods to measure political ideology in the electorate and its causal effects in congressional primary elections.
Other projects employ Bayesian [and/or] causal inference methods to study voter identification requirements, electoral coalitions, and election forecasts.
My research is published in the <em>Election Law Journal</em> and <em>The Forum</em> and has been covered by the New York Times, the Washington Post, FiveThirtyEight, and more.</p>
<p>I am originally from St. Louis MO and went to college at the University of Missouri.
I&rsquo;ve also lived in Berkeley CA for a few summers.</p>
<p>For recreation, I like to play guitar (badly) and ride a road bike (slightly less badly).
I am trying to learn more about mixing cocktails.</p>
