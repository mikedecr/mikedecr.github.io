<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>The goal of this lesson is to simulate some data manipulation for a research project. This requires…</p>
<ul>
<li>setting up the project on your computer</li>
<li>Get data onto our computer (the <a href="http://electionstudies.org/studypages/anes_timeseries_cdf/anes_timeseries_cdf.htm">ANES</a> should already be downloaded!)</li>
<li>Load the data into R</li>
<li>Cleaning and modifying the data</li>
<li>Doing some simple calculations using the data</li>
</ul>
<p>Future lessons pick up where this one leaves off. We will be <a href="811/811-graphics">making graphics</a> and doing <a href="811/811-analysis">statistical analysis</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="setting-up-a-project" class="section level1">
<h1>Setting up a project</h1>
<p>Projects should have their own dedicated folder on your computer. Moreover, project folders should be internally organized, with separate folders for data, R scripts, writing, other documentation, and so on.</p>
<p>Here is an example of one of my project folders. The <code>R/</code> folder itself is a little disorganized at the moment, but you get the idea.</p>
<center>
<br> <img src="img/dir.png" alt="project-directory" style="width: 90%;"/>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>You should already have an <code>ps811/R/lessons/</code> folder. In that folder, create a <code>data/</code> folder to store the ANES data. You’ll want to save any <code>.R</code> files you are using in the <code>R/</code> folder. Here’s how I would recommend proceeding with R files for these lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download any corresponding script files from <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/86298">Canvas</a></li>
<li>Create your own R file for following along and practicing with variations on the provided code (this will be largely based on the script file from Canvas)</li>
<li>Optional: download the <code>.Rmd</code> file for these webpages from my <a href="https://github.com/mikedecr/site-source/tree/master/content/811">Github</a>. These files contain both code and the text on the web pages, but they are fairly easy to interpret. These files are easiest to use with Rstudio. Learn more <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some tips for setting up projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you name your folders and files, use hyphens or underscores to separate words, not spaces. Something like <code>811-data-lesson.R</code> is better than <code>811 data lesson.R</code>.</li>
<li>Use short folder names when you can. File names as well. This makes your life easier for navigating directory pathways and version-controlling your work (e.g. with Git, which I recommend learning at some point soon).</li>
<li>Avoid setting up the folders in ways that would require you to navigate <em>up</em> the directory tree. If that doesn’t immediately make sense, see the section below.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="directories" class="section level1">
<h1>Directories</h1>
<p>Just as you can look around your computer in the file browser (“Finder” on Mac and “Explorer” on Windows), R looks around your computer as well. The problem is, R is very stupid unless you tell it where to look for stuff.</p>
<p>If you open R, it looks some place on your computer by default. Here’s where mine is looking right now.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>getwd()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;/Users/michaeldecrescenzo/Box Sync/site/source/content/811&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If you type this command in R, it probably starts at the top of your user profile on your computer (e.g. <code>&quot;/Users/michaeldecrescenzo/&quot;</code>). If we want R to find our project files, however, we need to tell R to look in our project folder. Do this by setting the working directory. For example…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setwd(&quot;~/folder/pathway/to/project&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>You should set your directory to the <code>top</code> of the project folder, not all the way into the <code>data/</code> folder. You should do this because it’s always easier to navigate down a folder tree than up a folder tree. The code for navigating <em>out</em> a folder, <code>..</code>, doesn’t tell you which folder is the destination, so it can be confusing to depend on it.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>Let’s install some packages that we will use.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;magrittr&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Once you install these packages, you should comment out the installation commands in your script file. We don’t need to install them each time.</p>
<p>Now load the packages so they can be used in this R session.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;magrittr&quot;)
library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ──</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ✔ ggplot2 2.2.1     ✔ purrr   0.2.4
## ✔ tibble  1.3.4     ✔ dplyr   0.7.4
## ✔ tidyr   0.7.2     ✔ stringr 1.2.0
## ✔ readr   1.1.1     ✔ forcats 0.2.0</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
## ✖ tidyr::extract()   masks magrittr::extract()
## ✖ dplyr::filter()    masks stats::filter()
## ✖ dplyr::lag()       masks stats::lag()
## ✖ purrr::set_names() masks magrittr::set_names()</code></pre>
<p>When you load the <code>tidyverse</code> package, you actually load several packages that are <em>part of</em> the Tidyverse. We’ll explain what the Tidyverse is below.</p>
<p>You will notice that a warning message says that some function names in the <code>tidyverse</code> package “masks” some of the names in the <code>magrittr</code> and other packages. This means some of the object names in the packages are the same. This is <em>generally</em> something you should be watching out for, as your code may not work as intended. It is, however, not going to be a problem in this particular instance.</p>
</div>
<div id="loading-external-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Loading external data</h1>
<p>With your directory set at the top of your current project, find the ANES data file using <code>list.files()</code>. You can look inside folders by adding the folder path as an argument. The ANES data should be in the <code>data/</code> folder.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>list.files()
list.files(&quot;data&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>R has many functions for reading datasets into memory. They typically follow a format of <code>read.xyz()</code> (for base functions) or <code>read_xyz()</code> (for Tidyverse functions), where <code>xyz</code> refers to the file extension of interest.</p>
<p>We want to read a Stata file, which has the <code>.dta</code> extension. Many web pages will recommend using the <code>foreign</code> package, but <code>foreign</code> is pretty outdated and fails with newer Stata files. I’d recommend the <code>haven</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># download the package
install.packages(&quot;haven&quot;)

# use the package to read the data
library(&quot;haven&quot;)
anes &lt;- read_dta(&quot;data/anes_timeseries_cdf.dta&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This should take a few moments to load because the ANES cumulative file is a big file. Don’t worry.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-frames" class="section level1">
<h1>Data frames</h1>
<p>Most datasets you will work with in R are called “data frames.” These are basically R’s default dataset object. They are two-dimensional tables, but the columns (variables) have names. These are like the variable names we saw with Stata. What’s different about Stata is that, with R, we can have as many datasets in R’s current memory as we want. In Stata, you work with one table at a time.</p>
<p>Print the data to see what the table looks like.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>anes</code></pre>
<p>Technically speaking, the <code>anes</code> object is called a “tibble”, which is a special type of data frame created by the <code>tidyverse</code> package. Tibbles are different from ordinary data frames because they are prettier when they print out. If you want to see what I mean, you can coerce the <code>anes</code> object to a regular data frame and see the difference for yourself. You can enter the following code into R <em>at your own risk</em> and see the monstrosity that R tries to print out.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>as.data.frame(anes)</code></pre>
<p>Suffice it to say that R will try to print out what you ask it to. Tibble objects assume that you normally don’t want to print out something absolutely huge.</p>
<p>There are a few handy functions for learning about data frames.</p>
<p>We can get the number of rows. In this case, rows are survey respondents.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nrow(anes) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 55674</code></pre>
<p>We can also get the number of columns (variables).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ncol(anes)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 952</code></pre>
<p>You can print out the top or bottom of a data frame to get a glance of it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(anes) 
tail(anes)</code></pre>
<p>When we print the <code>anes</code> object, we don’t get a full list of variable names (because there are so many). To get the full set of names, use the <code>names()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(anes)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="variables-in-a-data-frame" class="section level1">
<h1>Variables in a data frame</h1>
<p>Here’s a weird R thing.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the <code>VCF0004</code> variable. The codebook (which you should have!) tells us that it’s the election cycle variable. Let’s print it out.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>VCF0004</code></pre>
<p>You should get an error.</p>
<p>Why? Because that variable isn’t an object we can directly access. Why? Because it’s <em>inside</em> the <code>anes</code> object, and R doesn’t know if we have variables with similar names in different datasets, so it’s being safe by not letting us access it directly. This is different from what we’re used to with Stata, but that’s because Stata confines you to one data table at a time. R lets you have as many objects as you want, so we have to be specific about which object we want to access.</p>
<p>To deal with this, we use the <code>$</code> character to tell R that a variable is located within a dataset. Let’s demonstrate (using the <code>head()</code> function to shorten the output).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(anes$VCF0004)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1948 1948 1948 1948 1948 1948</code></pre>
<p>That works.</p>
<p>You can see the full list of objects that R can access directly like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ls()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;anes&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This is sometimes called R’s “workspace” or R’s current memory. There’s no telling what these objects are from this output, only that there are objects with names in memory. They may have other objects “inside of” them or other accessible attributes, each of which require some other method to access them (the <code>$</code> for variables within data frames is <em>one way</em> of accessing an object’s attributes).</p>
</div>
<div id="attaching-data-and-why-you-should-never-do-it" class="section level1">
<h1>“Attaching” data, and why you should never do it</h1>
<p>Or, “my rant on attaching”…</p>
<p>Others may have advised you that <em>attaching</em> packages is one way of getting around the annoying <code>$</code> notation for variables within data frames.</p>
<p>Here’s my advice. <strong><em>Never attach.</em></strong> Do not do it. It does not do what you think it does, and it creates so many more (invisible) problems than it solves:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may have other objects in R memory with the same names. Many R functions create objects-within-objects that have the same names. Attaching is asking for trouble.</li>
<li>If attaching leads to a name clash, it can make some objects directly inaccessible by name.</li>
<li>Operations like sorting get weird when you attach. Sorting is usually something you want to do to a table of related variables at once. Attaching, however, conceptually ungroups these otherwise related vectors, and things like sorting become more difficult to mentally manage.</li>
<li>As you become more advanced with R, you will have many related datasets with the same names floating around, and attaching will mess things up. I promise.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. As a result, I’m declaring a strict (but in my opinion, defensible) policy around attaching: <strong>You may not attach.</strong> Do not attach data for your homework. Do not attach data for your final project. Do not attach data in a house or with a mouse. Attaching is a dangerous practice, and I will not endorse any use of it, especially not for newcomers to R.</p>
<p>Luckily for us (and all of the R community), the <code>tidyverse</code> package provides many tools that make attaching unnecessary.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-tidyverse" class="section level1">
<h1>The Tidyverse</h1>
<p>Now, the good stuff.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">Tidyverse</a> describes itself as…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying philosophy and common APIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That philosophy is based on <em>tidy data</em>, which refers to data organization where (1) rows contain cases, (2) columns contain variables, and (3) cells contain variable values.</p>
<p>Although this sounds simple, there are many data formats that do not fit that pattern. Legislative data, for example, is often represented as a vote matrix with legislators in rows and bills in columns. The cells, in turn, would contain <code>1</code>s and <code>0</code>s to indicate legislators’ Yea and Nay votes, respectively, on each bill. A tidy legislative voting dataset, on the other hand, would have a legislator variable, a bill variable, and a vote variable. Both datasets contain the same information, but the organization of the data allow for different sorts of manipulations. And it so happens that the tidy organization is particularly helpful for doing a lot of powerful stuff with R with very little code.</p>
<p>The Tidyverse is, historically, a collection of philosophicallly unified packages. The eponymous <code>tidyverse</code> package is a relatively new entity, which takes some of the most heavily used (but not all) Tidyverse components and places them into one package for convenience. The <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/">packages in the Tidyverse</a> are all designed to make data tidy or manipulate already-tidy data. Moreover, the tools are designed with a coherent syntax that makes them easy for beginners to learn, easy to understand (when you read the code), easy to integrate into complex analysis, and easy for visualizing data. It is hard for me, as someone who has been using R for years, to describe to newcomers just how much the Tidyverse has changed the way R is done in the past few years.</p>
<p>One enormous change that the Tidyverse has brought to the world R is the integration and popularization of the pipe operator from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html"><code>magrittr</code> package</a>. Although we will not cover the pipe operator until the end of this lesson, I encourage you <strong><em>not</em></strong> to view it as an afterthought. It drastically changes the way R is written and read, and I’d recommend you use it constantly.</p>
<p>For more resources about the Tidyverse (aside from this course), you can visit a webpage devoted to <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/">such resources</a>, which links you to the <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R 4 Data Science</a> book, a book on <a href="https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book"><code>ggplot2</code></a>, and various <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/">cheatsheets</a> for the constituent packages of the Tidyverse. I got my start using <a href="https://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/data_wrangling">this blog post</a>, which describes the pipe operator and two of the most important Tidyverse packages: <code>dplyr</code> and <code>tidyr</code>. We will cover the main points of the Tidyverse, but I would bookmark these resources for later browsing.</p>
<p><strong>One last note before <em>really</em> jumping in:</strong> It is a conscious decision to focus on the Tidyverse at the expense of other approaches (namely, “base R”). As I wrote in <a href="811/811-intro">the online introduction to these R lessons</a>, this is because we have a limited time to make R fun and accessible, and base R is neither. That being said, you may encounter base R online and in replication materials for other studies, so you should be open to learning a little bit about it online. But I would encourage against making it your “default” mode of doing R. Hopefully you’ll see how easy the Tidyverse is as we proceed!</p>
</div>
<div id="how-tidyverse-functions-work" class="section level1">
<h1>How <code>tidyverse</code> functions work</h1>
<p>Tidyverse literature refers to its core functions as “verbs.” These are functions that take a data frame and modify it.</p>
<p>When you call one of these verbs, you declare the dataset name in the function. This removes the need to specify the dataset when you call a variable. R assumes that variables are located in the declared dataset. A generic example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dataset &lt;- verb_name(dataset, verb_arguments = ...)</code></pre>
<p>We will review the following <code>tidyverse</code> functions from the <code>dplyr</code> package…</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rename()</code>: renaming variables</li>
<li><code>mutate()</code>: add/modify variables</li>
<li><code>select()</code>: grab certain columns (variables)</li>
<li><code>filter()</code>: grab certain rows (cases)</li>
<li><code>summarize()</code>: collapse/aggregate data (e.g. means)</li>
<li><code>group_by()</code>: create groups out of your data (e.g. for summarizing within group)</li>
<li><code>arrange()</code>: reordering rows</li>
<li>various <code>join</code> functions: for <em>merging</em> data</li>
</ul>
<p>And from the <code>tidyr</code> package (for making data tidy)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gather()</code>: turn many columns into one column (wide to long)</li>
<li><code>spread()</code>: turn one column into many columns (long to wide)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most data manipulation tasks fall under the umbrella of one or more of these functions. This is what makes the Tidyverse so useful: it has a small number of very powerful tools that facilitate nearly all common data munging tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="renaming" class="section level1">
<h1>Renaming</h1>
<p>The <code>rename()</code> function takes a data frame with one set of names, and it returns a data frame with different names.</p>
<p>Here, we rename the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>election year</li>
<li>respondents’ ratings of the two major US parties on a 7-pt ideological scale (1 “extremely liberal” to 7 “extremely conservative”)</li>
<li>respondents’ placement of themselves on the same scale</li>
<li>and a 7-pt index of party ID (Strong Democrat, Weak Democrat, Independent leaning Democrat, True Independent, Leaning Republican……)</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>anes &lt;- rename(anes, 
               cycle = VCF0004,
               libcon_demparty = VCF0503, 
               libcon_repparty = VCF0504, 
               libcon_self = VCF0803,
               pid7 = VCF0301)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="modifying-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Modifying data</h1>
<p>You can modify the columns of a dataset by creating new variables or modifying existing variables. The <code>mutate()</code> function takes a data frame and either adds or overwrites columns as specified.</p>
<p>We’ll use <code>mutate()</code> to recode some variables. To understand the recoding task, we’ll first look at the ideological self-placement variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table(anes$libcon_self, exclude = NULL)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##     0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     9  &lt;NA&gt; 
##  1748   750  3138  3603  9873  5304  5379   995  9568 15316</code></pre>
<p>Only the values 1–7 are valid. We want to recode everything else as <code>NA</code>. There are many ways to do this.</p>
<div id="the-ifelse-function" class="section level2">
<h2>The <code>ifelse()</code> function</h2>
<p>The <code>ifelse()</code> function follows the following psueocode:</p>
<pre><code>if (this) then {that} 
  else {something else}</code></pre>
<p>Phrased differently, it checks if something in the data is true, and if it’s true it does <em>A</em>, and if it’s false it does <em>B</em>. Here it is in action within a call to <code>mutate()</code>. The function is long, so I have to get creative with code indentation to make it readable, so bear with me.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># ifelse(logical test, result if TRUE, result if FALSE)
anes &lt;- mutate(anes, 
  libcon_self = 
    ifelse(libcon_self == 0 | libcon_self &gt;= 8 | is.na(libcon_self), 
           NA, 
           libcon_self),
  libcon_demparty = ifelse(libcon_demparty %in% 1:7, libcon_demparty, NA))</code></pre>
<p>We recode two variables in this <code>mutate()</code> call. We use <code>ifelse()</code> in slightly different ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>libcon_self</code> is 0 <em>or</em> greater than or equal to 8 <em>or</em> NA, then recode to <code>NA</code>, else recode to the existing value of <code>libcon_self</code> (i.e. no change).</li>
<li>If <code>libcon_demparty</code> is an integer value 1 through 7, keep it the way it is, else recode to <code>NA</code>. We’ll return to the <code>%in%</code> operator at the end of this section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the binary logical operators as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A == B</code>: A is equal to B</li>
<li><code>A &gt;= B</code>: A is greater than or equal to B</li>
<li><code>A &lt;= B</code>: A is less than or equal to B</li>
<li><code>A | B</code>: A or B</li>
<li><code>A &amp; B</code>: A and B</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that nothing can be <em>equal to</em> <code>NA</code>. That’s because <code>NA</code> isn’t a value; it’s a stand-in. Use the <code>is.na()</code> function instead.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-case_when-function" class="section level2">
<h2>The <code>case_when()</code> function</h2>
<p>When we have multiple rules stacked on top of another, things can get hairy. Pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>if (this) {that} 
  else {if (this) {that} 
         else {if (this) {that} 
                 else {something else} } }</code></pre>
<p>This would be difficult to code with <code>ifelse()</code>, because we would need to nest multiple <code>ifelse()</code> calls inside of each other, which is tedious and prone to mistakes.</p>
<p>We can avoid this using the <code>case_when()</code> function, which bills itself as a “vectorized <code>ifelse()</code>.” Here it is in action:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>anes &lt;- mutate(anes,
  libcon_repparty = case_when(
                      libcon_repparty == 1 ~ libcon_repparty,
                      libcon_repparty == 2 ~ libcon_repparty,
                      libcon_repparty %in% c(3, 4) ~ libcon_repparty,
                      libcon_repparty %in% (5:7) ~ libcon_repparty),
  pid7 = case_when(pid7 %in% 1:7 ~ pid7))</code></pre>
<p>The replacement value comes after the <code>~</code>. Translated:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>libcon_repparty</code> is equal to 1, replace with <code>libcon_repparty</code> (i.e. keep the same). If it is 2, keep the same. Same with values 3 and 4, and 5 through 7. The only reason I break these into different conditions is to show you different ways to do this logical matching.</li>
<li>If the <code>pid7</code> variable is an integer value 1 through 7, keep it the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something you should know about <code>case_when()</code> is that any value of an existing variable that is not logically matched will be automatically recoded to <code>NA</code>. You can override the automatic recoding by specifying a catch-all recode value, <code>TRUE ~ catch_all_replacement</code>.</p>
<p>The above code also features the <code>%in%</code> operator, which is a godsend. It is useful because…</p>
<ul>
<li><code>x == (1 | 2 | 3)</code> doesn’t work</li>
<li><code>x == 1 | x == 2 | x == 3</code> works but is annoying</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, it is easier to type <code>x %in% c(1, 2, 3)</code> (or <code>x %in% 1:3</code> if matching adjacent integers). What this means is “x is in the set of {1, 2, 3}.” It works like the <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span> operator in set theory.</p>

<div id="tips-for-recoding" class="section level2">
<h2>Tips for recoding</h2>
<p>Depending on what you’re doing, you may not find it valuable to recode the original data. Instead you might create a new variable that modifies the original. If you want to pitch the original variables later, you can do it with the <code>select()</code> function (described below), but at least you don’t need to muck through lots of code to get the originals back. You can just…not delete them.</p>
<p>When you recode new variables, you might want to compare the new and old variables using the <code>table()</code> function.</p>
<p>I try to consolidate all of my data cleaning tasks into as few calls to <code>mutate()</code> as possible. This makes it easy to retrace your steps. In fact, I usually devote an entire <code>.R</code> file in my project solely to cleaning the original data. Once the data are clean, I save a cleaned dataset, and then load the cleaned dataset for subsequent analyses.</p>
</div>
<div id="variables-from-other-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Variables from other variables</h2>
<p>Intuitively, you can create variables from other variables.</p>
<p>Here, we calculate the ideological distance between one’s self placement and their placement of the two parties. We also calculate how far apart they perceive the parties to be. The sign of the result (<span class="math inline">\(+/-\)</span>) indicates the ideological direction of the difference. Negative values indicate that respondents find themselves to be more liberal than a party, or that they find the Republican Party to be more liberal than the Democratic Party (which would be weird, but hey, that’s survey data for you).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>anes &lt;- mutate(anes, 
               dem_distance = libcon_self - libcon_demparty,
               rep_distance = libcon_self - libcon_repparty,
               party_distance = libcon_repparty - libcon_demparty)</code></pre>
<p><code>mutate()</code> is great because you can create a variable in one line and use it in another line, without ending the <code>mutate()</code> call. Pretty convenient! Here’s an example.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_frame(x = 1:3, 
           y = 4:6, 
           z = x + y, 
           abc = z * z)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 4
##       x     y     z   abc
##   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1     1     4     5    25
## 2     2     5     7    49
## 3     3     6     9    81</code></pre>
<p>Side note: this also shows how you can create data frames using the <code>data_frame()</code> function.</p>

<div id="selecting-columns" class="section level1">
<h1>Selecting columns</h1>
<p>Maybe you don’t need all these variables for something. You can select specific variables using the <code>select()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>select(anes, cycle, pid7)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 55,674 x 2
##    cycle      pid7
##    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;

##  2  1948        NA

##  9  1948        NA
## 10  1948        NA
## # ... with 55,664 more rows</code></pre>
<p>(The <code>pid7</code> variable is only <code>NA</code> because the variable isn’t valid for very old survey years. There is nothing wrong here.)</p>
<p>There are various “select helper” functions that aid us in selecting variables. Let’s look at the last of the variable names that we’ve created:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tail(names(anes))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;VCF9153&quot;        &quot;VCF9154&quot;        &quot;VCF9155&quot;        &quot;dem_distance&quot;  
## [5] &quot;rep_distance&quot;   &quot;party_distance&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We can select a range of variables using the <code>:</code> operator, kind of analogous to the way we can create sequences of integers. He we will grab the variables between <code>dem_distance</code> and <code>party_distance</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>select(anes, cycle, dem_distance:party_distance)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 55,674 x 4
##    cycle dem_distance rep_distance party_distance
##    &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;      &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;
##  1  1948           NA           NA             NA
##  2  1948           NA           NA             NA
##  3  1948           NA           NA             NA
##  4  1948           NA           NA             NA
##  5  1948           NA           NA             NA
##  6  1948           NA           NA             NA
##  7  1948           NA           NA             NA
##  8  1948           NA           NA             NA

## # ... with 55,664 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Again, the <code>NA</code> values are just because of the survey year that we can see in the preview.</p>
<p>We can select variables by partial name matches.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>select(anes, cycle, contains(&quot;libcon&quot;))</code></pre>

<p>For instance, let’s say we want to do the above calculation but within each election year.</p>

<p>A data frame can later be ungrouped with (wait for it…) <code>ungroup()</code>.</p>
<p>Here we also see the <code>n()</code> function, which behaves like <code>nrow()</code> but within <code>tidyverse</code> functions. If the dataset is grouped, <code>n()</code> returns the sample size in each group.</p>
<p><code>group_by()</code> and <code>n()</code> also work with <code>mutate()</code>. For example, if we wanted to calculate an ideological Z-score for respondents in each election year, we could group by election year and then standardize the scores.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>z &lt;- mutate(group_by(anes, cycle),

<h1>Joining (merging)</h1>
<p>Because the ANES is so big, this concept will be clearer if we use a toy example. Here we have two datasets with some overlapping cases and some non-overlapping cases.</p>

                     var1 = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 2

## 1     2     x
## 2     3     y
## 3     4     z</code></pre>
<p>Both datasets contain cases 2 and 3, but only one dataset contains case 1 and the other dataset contains case 4. So we have partially-overlapping data frames.</p>
<p>What we want to accomplish is putting these datasets together into one table, matching data to the appropriate cases.</p>
<p>The <code>full_join()</code> function keeps all cases from both datasets. Non-matching cells are filled with <code>NA</code> by default, but you can specify replacement values for non-matches if you wish.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full_join(data1, data2, by = &quot;case&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 4 x 3

## 4     4  &lt;NA&gt;     z</code></pre>
<p>Note: You can merge along multiple variables using <code>by = c(&quot;var1&quot;, &quot;var2&quot;, ...)</code>. If you want to match dyad-years, you would want to match both the dyad and the year.Here’s a pretend example using stylized Correlates of War and M.I.D.s data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full_join(cow, mids, by = c(&quot;country1&quot;, &quot;country2&quot;, &quot;year&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><code>left_join()</code> keeps all cases from left dataset. If the right dataset can’t fill a cell in the left dataset, the result is <code>NA</code>. If the right dataset has cases that don’t fit into the left, they disappear.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>left_join(data1, data2, by = &quot;case&quot;)</code></pre>

## 3     4  &lt;NA&gt;     z</code></pre>
<p><code>inner_join()</code> keeps only cases with matches in both datasets.</p>

<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 3

<p><code>anti_join()</code> is different. It keeps only the <em>unmatched</em> cases (from the left dataset only). This is helpful for diagnosing a problem with an imperfect attempt to join two data frames.</p>

<h1>Tidyr functions</h1>
<p>This concludes today’s foray into the <code>dplyr</code> family of functions. Now we’ll switch to the <code>tidyr</code> functions. The main difference is that <code>dplyr</code> tends to <em>change</em> data while <code>tidyr</code> simply moves it around.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about “wide” and “long” data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wide data might be data from multiple time periods, where variables from different time periods are represented as different columns. So we might have different <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variables from three different time periods as columns named <code>x1</code>, <code>x2</code>, <code>x3</code>, <code>y1</code>, <code>y2</code>, <code>y3</code>.</li>
<li>Long data would have the same information as the wide data, but instead of different variables for time periods, we stack the time periods on top of one another into one variable. So we would have variables for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> as well as a <code>time_period</code> variable to indicate which observations come from which wave.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we shape data, what we’re really doing is moving data around (also called “reshaping”) to make it long (elongating) or wide (widening).</p>
</div>
<div id="elongating-with-gather" class="section level1">
<h1>Elongating with <code>gather()</code></h1>
<p>Gathering will take multiple columns and stack the cells into one variable (with an accompanying variable for labeling).</p>
<p>Here is an example using the ideological distance variables from above. First we have to prep some data so we can see how this works.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># keep only certain variables

               rep_distance = mean(rep_distance, na.rm = TRUE))

## 3  2012     1.544756    -1.227141</code></pre>
<p>We’ll gather the two distance variables into one variable, with another variable to indicate which party we’re contrasting.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># gather(data, resulting key, resulting value, initial varlist)
l &lt;- gather(d, key = party, value = distance, dem_distance, rep_distance)

<div id="piping-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Piping data</h1>
<p>Now that we have covered some essential tools for wrangling data, let’s tie it all together with the concept of piping.</p>
<p>Let’s start by identifying the problem. Data processing requires a lot of steps (each represented by the functions we have learned so far). Many of these steps are related. Can we string these operations together in a way that is easy to understand and easy to write?</p>
<p>One way to sew multiple operations together is with nested functions. Just as we can nest functions in math like <span class="math inline">\(f(g(h(x)))\)</span>, we can also do this with R. The problem with this is that the order of operations creates an unintuitive reading experience—we have to read from the inside out. The code becomes ugly and difficult to interpret.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_data &lt;- gather(summarize(group_by(filter(select(dataset, ...), ...), ...), ...), ...)</code></pre>
<p>Another way would be to break up the operation into multiple lines. The problem with this method is that it is verbose and creates a lot of redundancy with object assignment (which can slow down your code with big datasets).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>d &lt;- select(dataset, ...)
d &lt;- filter(d, ...)
d &lt;- group_by(d, ...)
d &lt;- summarize(d, ...)
d &lt;- gather(d, ...)</code></pre>
<p>We’ll use the pipe operator <code>%&gt;%</code> to make this process easier. The pipe operator takes a left-hand side object and “pipes” it into a right-hand side function. It sounds trivial, but just wait. Here is how it works. We’ll use <code>x</code> to represent data and <code>f</code> to represent functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, <code>x %&gt;% f()</code> sets <code>x</code> as the first argument in <code>f</code>. So <code>f(x)</code> is equivalent to <code>x %&gt;% f()</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> is needed elsewhere inside of <code>f</code> besides the first argument, we can use <code>.</code> to stand-in for <code>x</code>. For example, <code>f(arguments, data = x)</code> is equivalent to <code>x %&gt;% f(arguments, data = .)</code>.</li>
<li>If only one argument is needed, the parentheses on <code>f()</code> could be omitted. So <code>f(x)</code> is equivalent to <code>x %&gt;% f(.)</code> is equivalent to <code>x %&gt;% f()</code> is equivalent to <code>x %&gt;% f</code>. I would recommend not omitting parentheses, however, because keeping parentheses makes it easier to see which names are associated with data and which names are associated with functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pipe operator allows you to do multiple dataset operations in a <em>linear</em> fashion without creating a ton of intermediary objects. The above processing task could be written as the following “pipe chain.”</p>
<pre class="r"><code>d &lt;- dataset %&gt;%
  select(...) %&gt;%
  filter(...) %&gt;%
  group_by(...) %&gt;%
  summarize(...) %&gt;%
  gather(...) %&gt;%
  print() </code></pre>
<p>Adding <code>print()</code> at the end of the chain will print <code>d</code> after the results of the pipe chain are assigned to <code>d</code>.</p>
<p>As we can see, the pipe chain has made our code linear and readable, and it makes our workflow more straightforward and efficient (because we can <em>think</em> linearly again). Reading a complex set of operations linearly isn’t normally something you can easily do with programming, so we should really appreciate this!</p>
<p>Here’s an example using real data. The pipe chain makes it extremely easy to understand exactly what the code is doing. This is thanks both to the pipe itself, but also the ease with which each <code>tidyverse</code> function can be interpreted by an observer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>l &lt;- anes %&gt;%
  select(cycle, contains(&quot;distance&quot;)) %&gt;%
  filter(cycle %in% c(2004, 2008, 2012)) %&gt;%
  group_by(cycle) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n(),
            Democratic = mean(dem_distance, na.rm = TRUE),
            Republican = mean(rep_distance, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%
  gather(key = party, value = distance, Democratic, Republican) %&gt;%
  print() </code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 4
##   cycle     n      party  distance
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1  2004  1212 Democratic  1.411499
## 2  2008  2322 Democratic  1.090385
## 3  2012  5914 Democratic  1.544756
## 4  2004  1212 Republican -1.048588
## 5  2008  2322 Republican -1.014839
## 6  2012  5914 Republican -1.227141</code></pre>
<p>We can use pipes to simplify other tasks from earlier in this lesson, like processing a table using proportions and rounding but without all of the nested functions.</p>

<p>If your text editor has the capability, <em>create a keyboard shortcut for the pipe operator!</em> I create this kind of thing with Sublime Text all the time. Rstudio can do it as well. Here’s what I do:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>super + .</code> creates a pipe</li>
<li><code>super + shift + .</code> creates a pipe and adds a new line</li>
<li>relatedly, I use <code>super + shift + ,</code> to create an assignment operator (<code>&lt;-</code>).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="other-helpful-pipes" class="section level1">
<h1>Other helpful pipes</h1>
<p>There is one other helpful pipe-like operator that we will talk about: <code>%$%</code>. It tells a right-hand function that the variable names in the function come from the left-hand dataset. It doesn’t pipe the entire dataset per se; it only says “look here for variable names.” The two following commands do the same thing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table(anes$pid7)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##     1     2     3     4     5     6     7 
## 10805 11261  6396  6409  5382  7413  6354</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>anes %$% table(pid7)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## pid7
##     1     2     3     4     5     6     7 
## 10805 11261  6396  6409  5382  7413  6354</code></pre>

<div id="saving-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Saving data</h1>
<p>You can write or save data from R with many <code>write.xyz</code> or <code>save.xyz</code> functions. I usually prefer to save data in an R-specific format.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>saveRDS(anes, &quot;data/anes-modified.RDS&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>If it’s possible that someone using Stata (or some other software) might be using your data, you might save in a more accessible format such as <code>.csv</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>write_csv(anes, &quot;data/anes-modified.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>R can read and save to a multitude of file types, including <code>.dta</code> for Stata (RIP Stat/Transfer). Some packages provide “swiss-army-knife” data input/output services, such as the <code>import()</code> function in Thomas Leeper’s <code>rio</code> package.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level1">
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>There is a lot more “nitty gritty” when it comes to data management in R than in Stata. Luckily, the <code>tidyverse</code> provides powerful tools that do a lot of heavy lifting for you. Moreover, these tools have a coherent, shared interface which makes them easy to use and understand. Although we covered piping last, you should not view it as an optional afterthought. It is extremely useful, and you will be much more efficient with R if you embrace it. Make sure you are comfortable with piping, <code>dplyr</code>, and <code>tidyr</code> before beginning the <a href="811/811-graphics">lesson on graphics</a>.</p>
<p>There are some data-munging tasks that we will cover in the final lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing your own functions</li>
<li>Loops (and why you should not use them)</li>
<li><code>apply()</code> functions (and why you should use them instead of loops)</li>
<li>Nesting and mapping, a tidy (and parallel!) method for applying complex functions across many datasets at once.</li>

<h1>Postscript on coding style</h1>
<p>I would talk about coding style, but others can probably do that better than I can (though you can check the R scripts on Canvas for do-as-I-do examples). You can find lots of style guides for R online. They will broadly agree on how to write R with good style, but they won’t agree on every fine point. Here are some that I endorse:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html">short style guide</a> by Hadley Wickham that will put you on the right track</li>
<li>a <a href="http://style.tidyverse.org/">longer style guide</a> (again by Wickham) that has general style guidance but also guidance specifically for working with the <code>tidyverse</code>, for those who want to be a little more obsessive about their programming style</li>
