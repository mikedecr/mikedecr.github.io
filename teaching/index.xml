      <description>Causal Inference Reading Group In 2019 I organized and led discussion for a summer reading group on causal inference methods. Much of the material focused on &amp;ldquo;the view from political science,&amp;rdquo; but we regularly incorporated material from statistics, economics, and epidemiology. We discussed potential outcomes and graphical models for causal inference and estimation methods using regression, propensity score adjustment, and structural models.
The reading list below contains both the assigned and the &amp;ldquo;bonus&amp;rdquo; readings.</description>

      <description>Political Science 270: Understanding Political Numbers Data are increasingly prevalent in politics (and in journalism, industry, academia&amp;hellip;), but data are complex and challenging. What can we learn about politics, and the social world more broadly, when we take an empirical view of it? When should we trust data, and when will data lead us astray?
Political science 270 is an undergraduate course on consuming, criticizing, and producing data-driven analysis of political and social phenomena.</description>
