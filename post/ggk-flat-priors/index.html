<p>I’ve been reading about Bayesian causal inference for a paper I’m hoping to write, and this has led me to dig into the work by <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RDueAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=gerber+green+kaplan&amp;ots=0I3f6Jfn33&amp;sig=wVKOfRF39mkiT4vnMe8YecMMpeY#v=onepage&amp;q=gerber%20green%20kaplan&amp;f=false">Gerber, Green, and Kaplan</a> (hereafter “GGK”) about the “Illusion of Learning from Observational Research.” In it, they put forth a model to describe how much you “update” your information about causal effects from experimental vs. observational research.</p>
<p>The intuition of the model? Suppose that we want to learn about some true causal effect <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. When we conduct a study, our estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}\)</span> reflects the true effect <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, plus bias <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, plus error <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  \hat{T} &amp;= \tau + \beta + \epsilon,
\end{align}\]</span>
What we want to do is update our information about <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. Under what conditions do we learn a lot about it?</p>
<p>Suppose we collect a ton of data, so the variance of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}\)</span> shrinks to be very small. This is similar to shrinking <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> toward zero, so we’re pretty certain what <span class="math inline">\(\tau + \beta\)</span> is, but we’ve only identified their sum. We don’t know how much of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> and how much is <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here’s the thrust of their argument. If we want to update our priors about <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> specifically, we need a study design where we have clear priors about <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. If our study is experimental, we can assume <em>a priori</em> that the size of the bias <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is either zero or very small. This way, learning about <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}\)</span> allows us to learn a lot about <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. When we are in an observational study, we don’t know as much about the size of the bias <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, and the data don’t allow us to update those priors independently of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. As a result, the data can’t tell us as much about <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, only <span class="math inline">\(\tau + \beta\)</span>.</p>
<p>This model makes a lot of sense. When you have vague priors about the bias in a study, you don’t know how to interpret its findings. Fair!</p>
<div id="but" class="section level1">
<h1>But…</h1>
<p>The namesake of GGK’s theoretical model, the <strong>Illusion of Learning from Observational Research</strong>, is the model’s result where we have <em>flat priors</em> about the bias <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. Under a flat prior, we learn <em>nothing</em> from having conducted an observational study because the bias could be <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>What I want to assert is that the “flat priors” result is a degenerate case. It does not accurately characterize observational research, and it never really occurs in real life. As a result, we need to be careful interpreting the model to avoid overstating what it actually says about real-world observational research.</p>
<p>Suppose we conduct an observational study and detect an effect of size <span class="math inline">\(1.0\)</span>. If we are concerned about uncorrected bias in the study design, practically speaking we are mainly concerned with the possibility that the effect is <em>over-estimated</em>—unobserved confounders drive self-selection into treatment, inflating the causal effect estimate. This would give us a prior that the true effect most likely falls somewhere between 0 and the observational effect size. Meaning, we actually have pretty specific priors about the bias. Would we put much probability on the possibility that the true effect is <em>double</em> the estimated effect, or greater? Probably not, since most of the time we are worried about self-selection into treatment. Do we think that the true effect is just as big as the estimated effect, but in the exact opposite direction? Again, probably not, especially if we have theorized carefully about our expectations for the study.</p>
<p>We can see it better by rearranging terms. Setting <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for a moment…
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  \beta &amp;= \hat{T} - \tau
\end{align}\]</span>
The bias <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the difference between the true and observed effects, so our prior for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the difference in our priors for the true and estimated effects. If we have some expectation about the true and estimated effects—and we normally do…—then we have reasonably clear priors about the size of the bias in observational studies.</p>
<p>What does a Bayesian say? Our priors aren’t flat, but so the “Illusion” of learning in observational studies is an overstatement (or even “sleight of hand”). I worry how many people have read the original GGK piece and come away with the impression that flat priors about <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is a fair or accurate representation of observational research. I don’t mean this as a defense of biased research—rather, it is a criticism of flat priors. I don’t know if GGK intended for the flat priors case to be interpreted as “realistic”—on the one hand, the flat-priors result is the namesake of the piece, but their numerical example uses a non-flat prior for the bias term—but if a reader isn’t already thinking hard about their priors, then it’s easy to see how they might not catch this.</p>
</div>
<div id="zooming-out" class="section level1">
<h1>Zooming out</h1>
<p>There are a few mid-level lessons we could reinforce by thinking about our priors about bias in observational studies.</p>
<p>First, there’s never a bad time to remember that (improper) flat priors are unrealistic. Inferences under flat priors can look like inferences under informed priors if the data are strong enough, but we should worry about any exercise where some theoretical result <em>necessarily depends</em> on an assumption of flat priors. In thought experiments and in real data analysis, you can always do better than a flat prior.</p>
<p>Relatedly, Bayesians are keen to highlight areas where informed priors provide important stability to some result that would have looked like nonsense under flat priors. This is one of those cases. Flat priors lead you in an unstable direction assessing the information conveyed by research. It’s only in a case where you have more informed priors about the terms in the GGK model where the results conform to how we actually think about research findings.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Lastly, I am increasingly preoccupied by the way Bayes’ theorem is routinely used in theoretical models to convey important intuitions about causal inference and yet there is so little formal incorporation of Bayesian priors in applied data analysis of credible research designs (in political science at least; other fields mix these things much more). I’m trying to write a paper about doing applied Bayesian analysis in causal inference, and I hope the causal inference crowd can be convinced to legalize it!</p>
</div>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>
Furthermore, it is worth emphasizing that flat priors are only flat <em>with respect to a likelihood</em>. As soon as you have a quantity that is a function of multiple parameters, the prior for this resulting quantity will <em>not</em> be flat even if the priors for each parameter are flat. If you have ever demonstrated the Central Limit Theorem by summing a bunch of uniform random variables that results in a bell curve, you have already seen this in action!<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
